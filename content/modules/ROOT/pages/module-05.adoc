# Module 5: Backup/Restore container workloads

Trident Protect can help you protect *applications*.

Now, what *_is_* an application? How do you *_define_* it? +
Very philosophical questions, isn't it?

10 people may have 10 different answers. +
With Trident Protect, you can define applications in multiple ways:

* with *Labels* (ie subset of a namespace)
* a whole namespace
* multiple namespaces at Once

NOTE: You can also bring cluster wide resources in the Application definition.

Two different examples with the Wordpress environment you have deployed: 

* Application by namespace: everything in the namespace will be protected as one (PVC, POD, ConfigMaps, ...)
* Application by label: you could protect the frontend & the backend differently, maybe with different schedules.

[NOTE]
====
In some cases, you may need to interact with the application to ensure consistency.
True that not all applications write their data on the disk all the time. Maybe there is a cache or a buffer involved.
Trident Protect uses *hooks* to perform some tasks, such as requesting data flush before taking a snapshot.
====

Enough reading for now, let's protect WordPress!

[#creation]
== Create a Trident Protect application for the Wordpress namespace

Make sure you are logged into the production cluster. +
Defining an application can be done with the _tridentctl-protect_ cli or via CR (more adapted for GitOps methodologies).

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
tridentctl-protect create app wordpress --namespaces wordpress -n wordpress
----
TIP: running this command with the `--dry-run` parameter will display the corresponding YAML manifest

[NOTE]
====
* The _application_ is created by the app owner (ie the Wordpress admin)
* It is also created in the application namespace, ie if the whole namespace is deleted, the Trident Protect objects will be deleted also. But thanks to the AppVault & backups, you can easily restore everything
* The `--namespaces` parameter is used to define which _namespaces_ to protect (`wordpress` in your case), as well as _labels_ if necessary
====

Check that the application is present:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
tridentctl-protect get app -n wordpress
----
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
+-----------+------------+-------+-----+
|   NAME    | NAMESPACES | STATE | AGE |
+-----------+------------+-------+-----+
| wordpress | wordpress  | Ready | 26s |
+-----------+------------+-------+-----+
----

[#snapshot]
== Create an application snapshot of your application

An application snapshot is composed of several steps:

* Pre snapshot hook (optional) to interact with your application (ex: Freeze the MariaDB database to flush the data on the disk)
* *CSI Snapshot* for each volume of the application
* Copy of all the *application metadata* onto the AppVault
* Post snapshot hook (optional) to interact with your application (ex: Thaw the MariaDB database)

[NOTE]
====
Hooks are not covered here in this lab.
You can find examples on this repo: https://github.com/NetApp/Verda
====

Let's create one snapshot of the Wordpress app:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
tridentctl protect create snapshot wpsnap1 --app wordpress --appvault lab-vault -n wordpress
----
Check that the snapshot is done:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
tridentctl protect get snap -n wordpress
----
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
+-----------+--------------+-----------+-----+-------+
|   NAME    |    APP REF   |   STATE   | AGE | ERROR |
+-----------+--------------+-----------+-----+-------+
|  wpsnap1  |   wordpress  | Completed | 11s |       |
+-----------+--------------+-----------+-----+-------+
----

[#backup]
== Create an application backup of your application

A application backup is pretty similar to a snapshot. +
The main difference being that data is also going to be copied to the object store (with `Kopia` or `Restic`). +
A backup is always based on a snapshot. If you don't specify one, Trident Protect will automatically create one for you. +
You can also optionally use hooks in this process (`pre-backup-hook` & `post-backup-hook`).

Let's create one backup of the Wordpress app, based on the snapshot you just took:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
tridentctl protect create backup wpbkp1 --app wordpress --snapshot wpsnap1 --appvault lab-vault -n wordpress
----
Check that the backup is done:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
tridentctl protect get backup -n wordpress
----
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
+-----------+--------------+-----------+-------+-------+
|   NAME    |    APP REF   |   STATE   |  AGE  | ERROR |
+-----------+--------------+-----------+-------+-------+
|   wpbkp1  |   wordpress  | Completed | 1m15s |       |
+-----------+--------------+-----------+-------+-------+
----

NOTE: It is expected for the backup to take more time than the snapshot, as data is also copied

[#schedule]
== Create an protection schedule for your application

Manually creating snapshots and backups is one thing...  +
Automating their creation is another one.

You can also create protection schedules with Trident Protect. +
The _trident-protect_ can also be used for this, however you are going to use a YAML manifest in the lab console. +

Make sure you are logged into the production cluster.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----

+-------------+-----------+--------------------------------+---------+-------+-----+-------+
----
After a few minutes, you are going to see new snapshots and backups appearing with the following command:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
tridentctl-protect get snapshot -n wordpress
tridentctl-protect get backup -n wordpress
----

[#restore]
== Restore your application

While protection is done for the whole application, restoring an application offers multiple choices: 

* You can perform a *complete restore* or a *partial restore*
* You can restore your application *in-place* or in a *different namespace* (same cluster or a different cluster)
* You can even tailor the restore with a *post-restore hook*

TBC TBC TBC TBC TBC
=> destroy app or just restore on DR
=> OCP context in the console

Let's perform a full restore on the DR cluster! 

For this, you first need to find out the full path of your backup in the bucket. +
From the console, run the 2 following commands to browse the AppVault:

Now that you have the full path of your backup, you can easily restore it on the DR cluster.

Let's put the path of the backup in a variable and proceed with the restore
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
BKPPATH=$(tridentctl protect get appvaultcontent lab-vault --app wordpress --show-resources backup --show-paths -n trident-protect | grep wpbkp1  | awk -F '|' '{print $8}')

tridentctl protect create br wpbr1 --namespace-mapping wordpress:wordpressrestore --appvault lab-vault -n wordpressrestore \
  --storageclass-mapping storage-class-nfs:storage-class-iscsi-fs \
  --path $BKPPATH
----
After a couple of minutes, the process should be done:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
tridentctl protect get br -n wordpressrestore
----
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
+---------+---------------+-----------+-----+-------+
|  NAME   |    APPVAULT   |   STATE   | AGE | ERROR |
+---------+---------------+-----------+-----+-------+
|  wpbr1  |   lab-vault   | Completed | 48s |       |
+---------+---------------+-----------+-----+-------+
----

[NOTE]
====
* `br` stands for BackupRestore
* The _wordpressrestore_ namespace was automatically created by the tridentctl-protect binary
* This is also a good way to change storage class, and even protocol, as long as the access mode is supported by the target
