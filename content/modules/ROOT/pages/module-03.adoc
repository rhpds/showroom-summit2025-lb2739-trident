# Module 3: Provision workloads

In this chapter, you will perform the following tasks:

* Create a Virtual Machine with the OpenShift Console
* Create a containerized workload with the _cli_

[#deployvm]
== Deploy a simple VM with a Block RWX volume

* For this chapter, most tasks are going to be done in the OpenShift GUI. 

* Log into the PROD OpenShift console
** *URL*: {rosa_openshift_console_url}
** *user*: {rosa_openshift_admin_user}
** *password*: {rosa_openshift_admin_password}

* Create a new project (`my-vm` in the example)

image::Mod3_OCP_Console_Project_Create.png[projectCreation]

* Navigate to the `VirtualMachines` sub-menu of the `Virtualization` menu (make sure you are on the right project), press `Create `Virtual Machine` and then choose `From template`

image::Mod3_OCP_Console_VM_Create.png[VMCreation]

* Select the `CentOS Stream 9 VM` template. This will open a new form.
* Set the following parameters:
** Disk source: `PVC (clone PVC)`
** PVC project: `openshift-virtualization-os-images`
** PVC name: `centos-stream9-7ddf038605a5`
* Press `Quick create VirtualMachine`

[NOTE]
====
* There is no _default_ VM image available on a FSxN volume
* Since the iSCSI storage class you created is the default choice for Virtual Machines, you have to clone a volume when creating a VM
* You can customize the VM Name if you like
====

* Verify the objects related to that VM with the CLI

----
As you can see, the PVC is still in `Pending` state... Don't worry, this is expected. +
The volume template which is used in the example is available in the `gp3` storage class. +
That is because creating a Virtual Machine involves cloning that PVC to the FSxN system.

You can check the status of that cloning process with the following:

oc get datavolume -n my-vm

----

* It takes a few minutes for this clone to finish, at which point, the PVC because visible

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Do not wait for the VM Creation to complete as it takes roughly 10 minutes (unless you need a coffee).* 

*You can move to the next chapter of this module, which describes how to deploy WordPress, and come back to the VM later*

* You can also see the status of the VM in the Console:

image::Mod3_OCP_Console_VM_Running.png[VM Running]

[TIP]
====
Using the Trident *Cross Namespace Volume Clone* feature will greatly reduce the PVC creation when creating a new Virtual Machine from a Template. +
This is thanks to NetApp FlexClone technology, which does not use any storage when starting a volume clone.
====

* Now that the Virtual Machine is running, you can start adding some content. Press the `Open Web console` link (you can see in the previous screenshot under the miniature CentOS window)
* This opens a new window. First Press on the `Guest login credentials` link, and use the information you see to log into the system

image::Mod3_OCP_Console_CentOS_console.png[CentOS console]

* Create a file in the home directly

[#deploywordpress]
== Deploy the Wordpress Helm chart

First, you would need to log into the PROD cluster:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc login -u {rosa_openshift_admin_user} -p {rosa_openshift_admin_password} {rosa_openshift_api_url}
----

Wordpress is widely known as a blogging and content management platform. +
Let's deploy it on the production cluster with the help of a Helm chart.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

helm install wordpress bitnami/wordpress --version 24.1.18 -n wordpress --create-namespace \
  --set wordpressUsername=rosa \
  --set wordpressPassword=Rosa12345 \
  --set global.storageClass=storage-class-nfs \
  --set wordpressBlogName="Best Blog Ever"
----

NOTE: It takes a tiny bit more than a minute for the installation to complete.

Check the content of the `wordpress` namespace.

Notice the wordpress service ? +
Copy & paste the address provided by the Load Balancer in your browser in order to access WordPress:

image::Mod3_Wordpress_HelloWorld.png[HelloWorld]

Before protecting that application, you may want to create your own blog. +
You first need to connect to the admin page (use the same URL as Wordpress followed by "/wp-admin"). +
This will ask for credentials, which you set in the Helm chart (`rosa`/`Rosa12345`).

Once logged in, you need to click on `Posts` in the left bar, and then press on the `Add New Post` button.

image::Mod3_Wordpress_Admin_AddNewPost.png[AddNewPost]

Write Something nice or funny, and when ready press on the two successive `Publish` buttons. +
In another window, connect to the main page of the Wordpress user site to visualize the result.

image::Mod3_Wordpress_FirstPost.png[FirstPost]

Tadaaaa! +
Your first application is now ready.

* If you have not done it yet, you can go back to the Virtual Machine chapter to check that the creation is succesful, so that you can add some content to this VM

* You are now done with this module. Please proceed with the next one.
