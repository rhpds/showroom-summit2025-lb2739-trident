# Module 3: Provision workloads

In this chapter, you will perform the following tasks:

* Create a Virtual Machine with the OpenShift Console
* Create a containerized workload with the _cli_

[#deployvm]
== Deploy a simple VM with a Block RWX volume

For this chapter, most tasks are going to be done in the OpenShift GUI. 

=== Project creation

* Log into the PROD OpenShift console
** *URL*: {rosa_openshift_console_url}
** *user*: {rosa_openshift_admin_user}
** *password*: {rosa_openshift_admin_password}

* Create a new project (`my-vm` in the example)

=== VM creation

* Navigate to the `VirtualMachines` sub-menu of the `Virtualization` menu (make sure you are on the right project), press `Create `Virtual Machine` and then choose `From template`

image::Mod3_OCP_Console_VM_Create.png[VMCreation]

* Select the `CentOS Stream 9 VM` template. This will open a new form.
* Set the following parameters:
** Disk source: `PVC (clone PVC)`
** PVC project: `openshift-virtualization-os-images`
** PVC name: `centos-stream9-<UUID>`
* Press `Quick create VirtualMachine`

[NOTE]
====
* There is no _default_ VM image available on a FSxN volume
* Since the iSCSI storage class you created is the default choice for Virtual Machines, you have to clone a volume when creating a VM
* The PVC name might vary, depending on the latest version available in the lab environment. Choose the one that starts with centos-stream9
* You can customize the VM Name if you like
====

=== Verify the objects related to that VM with the CLI

First, you would need to log into the PROD cluster on the CLI:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc login -u {rosa_openshift_admin_user} -p {rosa_openshift_admin_password} {rosa_openshift_api_url}
----

Then check the status of the VM and its disk/PVC volume.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc -n my-vm get vm,pvc
----
[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----

virtualmachine.kubevirt.io/centos-stream9-salmon-crayfish-6   114s   Provisioning   False

NAME                                                STATUS    VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS          VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS   AGE
persistentvolumeclaim/centos-stream9-black-rat-76   Pending                                      storage-class-iscsi   <unset>                 114s
----
As you can see, the PVC is still in `Pending` state... Don't worry, this is expected. +
The volume template which is used in the example is available in the `gp3` storage class. +
That is because creating a Virtual Machine involves cloning that PVC to the FSxN system.

You can check the status of that cloning process with the following:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc get datavolume -n my-vm 
----
[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
NAME                               PHASE             PROGRESS   RESTARTS   AGE
centos-stream9-salmon-crayfish-6   CloneInProgress   46.95%                2m41s
----

* It takes a few minutes for this clone to finish, at which point, the PVC because visible

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Do not wait for the VM Creation to complete as it takes roughly 10 minutes (unless you need a coffee).* 

*You can move to the <<deploywordpress,next chapter>> of this module, which describes how to deploy WordPress, and come back to the VM later to check its status*

* You can also see the status of the VM in the Console:

[TIP]
====
Using the Trident *Cross Namespace Volume Clone* feature will greatly reduce the PVC creation when creating a new Virtual Machine from a Template. +
This is thanks to NetApp FlexClone technology, which does not use any storage when starting a volume clone.

[#deploywordpress]
== Deploy the Wordpress Helm chart

This is going to be done using the cli.


=== Wordpress installation

Wordpress is widely known as a blogging and content management platform. +
Let's deploy it on the production cluster with the help of a Helm chart.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

helm install wordpress bitnami/wordpress --version 24.1.18 -n wordpress --create-namespace \
  --set wordpressUsername=rosa \
  --set wordpressPassword=Rosa12345 \
  --set global.storageClass=storage-class-nfs \
  --set wordpressBlogName="Best Blog Ever"
----

NOTE: It takes a tiny bit more than a minute for the installation to complete.

=== Verify the installation

Check the content of the `wordpress` namespace.

You might have to wait a few more seconds and then repeat the above command until both pods show a staus of "Ready 1/1". 

Notice the wordpress service ? +
Copy & paste the address provided by the Load Balancer in your browser in order to access WordPress:

=== Create your own blog

Before protecting that application, you may want to create your own blog. +
You first need to connect to the admin page (use the same URL as Wordpress followed by "/wp-admin"). +
This will ask for credentials, which you set in the Helm chart (`rosa`/`Rosa12345`).

Once logged in, you need to click on `Posts` in the left bar, and then press on the `Add New Post` button.

image::Mod3_Wordpress_Admin_AddNewPost.png[AddNewPost]

Write Something nice or funny, and when ready press on the two successive `Publish` buttons. +
In another window, connect to the main page of the Wordpress user site to visualize the result.

image::Mod3_Wordpress_FirstPost.png[FirstPost]

Tadaaaa! +
Your first application is now ready.

=== Check VM Status

By now the VM should be fully deployed. Check the status again:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc -n my-vm get vm,pvc
----

* You are now done with this module. Please proceed with the next one.
