# Module 3: Provision workloads

In this chapter, you will perform the following tasks:

* Create a containerized workload with the _cli_
* Create a Virtual Machine with the OpenShift Console

== OpenShift context management

At this point, you already logged in both ROSA clusters. +
When using the `oc` tool, you can easily switch between clusters, by using the command `oc config use-context`. +

However, as the context names are pretty long, it is a good practice to rename them with the `oc config rename-context` command to avoid typing errors.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc config rename-context $(oc config get-contexts | grep -E default.*api-prod | cut -c 11- | awk '{print $1}') PROD
oc config rename-context $(oc config get-contexts | grep -E default.*api-dr | cut -c 11- | awk '{print $1}') DR
----

Let's quickly check this was succesfully applied:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc config get-contexts
----
[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
CURRENT   NAME   CLUSTER                                         AUTHINFO                                                      NAMESPACE
          DR     api-dr-p4p6h-t9k7-p1-openshiftapps-com:6443     cluster-admin/api-dr-p4p6h-t9k7-p1-openshiftapps-com:6443     default
*         PROD   api-prod-p4p6h-jtx8-p1-openshiftapps-com:6443   cluster-admin/api-prod-p4p6h-jtx8-p1-openshiftapps-com:6443   default
----

You should already be logged into the PROD environment. +
In case you need to switch back to it, here is the command to run:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]

oc config use-context PROD

Time to deploy workloads!

IMPORTANT: If you are only interested in protecting Virtual Machines, you can skip all the wordpress chapters.

[#deploywordpress]
== Deploy the Wordpress Helm chart

This is going to be done using the cli.

=== Wordpress installation

Wordpress is widely known as a blogging and content management platform. +
Let's deploy it on the production cluster with the help of a Helm chart.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

helm install wordpress bitnami/wordpress --version 24.1.18 -n wordpress --create-namespace \
  --set wordpressUsername=rosa \
  --set wordpressPassword=Rosa12345 \
  --set global.storageClass=storage-class-nfs \
  --set wordpressBlogName="Best Blog Ever"
----

NOTE: It takes a tiny bit more than a minute for the installation to complete.

=== Verify the installation

Check the content of the `wordpress` namespace.

You might have to wait a few more seconds and then repeat the above command until both pods show a staus of "Ready 1/1". 

Notice the wordpress service ? +
Copy & paste the address (the _EXTERNAL-IP_) provided by the Load Balancer in your browser in order to access WordPress:

image::Mod3_Wordpress_HelloWorld.png[HelloWorld]

[NOTE]
====
You could also retrieve this address by running the following command:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get -n wordpress svc wordpress -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}';echo
----
====

=== Create your own blog

Before protecting that application, you may want to create your own blog. +
You first need to connect to the admin page (use the same URL as Wordpress followed by "/wp-admin"). +
This will ask for credentials, which you set in the Helm chart (`rosa`/`Rosa12345`).

Once logged in, you need to click on `Posts` in the left bar, and then press on the `Add New Post` button.

image::Mod3_Wordpress_Admin_AddNewPost.png[AddNewPost]

Write Something nice or funny, and when ready press on the two successive `Publish` buttons. +
In another window, connect to the main page of the Wordpress user site to visualize the result.

image::Mod3_Wordpress_FirstPost.png[FirstPost]

Tadaaaa! +
Your first application is now ready.

[#deployvm]
== Deploy a simple VM with a Block RWX volume

For this chapter, most tasks are going to be done in the OpenShift GUI. 

=== Project creation

* Log into the PROD OpenShift console
** *URL*: {rosa_openshift_console_url}[window=_blank] icon:external-link[]
** *user*: {rosa_openshift_admin_user}
** *password*: {rosa_openshift_admin_password}

* Create a new project (`my-vm` in the example)

image::Mod3_OCP_Console_Project_Create.png[projectCreation]

=== VM creation

* Navigate to the `VirtualMachines` sub-menu of the `Virtualization` menu (make sure you are on the right project), press `Create `Virtual Machine` and then choose `From template`

image::Mod3_OCP_Console_VM_Create.png[VMCreation]

* Select the `CentOS Stream 9 VM` template. This will open a new form.

image::Mod3_OCP_Console_VM_Centos_template.png[VMTemplate, 220, 220]

[NOTE] 
====
As you can see, the template you are selecting is labelled `Source available`. +
This means that the corresponding image volume exists on this cluster with the default storage class condfigured for Virtual Machines.
====

* Leave all the default parameters
** including _Disk source = Template default_ (that will use the volume snapshot set during the optimization configuration in the previous module)
** you can optionally change the VM name
* Press `Quick create VirtualMachine`

image::Mod3_OCP_Console_VM_Form.png[VM Form]

=== Verify the objects related to that VM with the CLI

Check the status of the VM and its disk/PVC volume.

----
As you can see, the creation was super fast. +

NOTE: If the Template Image disk was on a different storage class, the process would have taken much longer (about 10 minutes), as it would first need to clone the data in a different volume.

* You can also see the status of the VM in the Console:

image::Mod3_OCP_Console_VM_Running.png[VM Running]

* You are now done with this module. Please proceed with the next one.
