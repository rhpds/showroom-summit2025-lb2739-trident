# Module 6: Disaster Recovery Plan for your VM

For this module, make sure you are connected to the OpenShift PROD Console, then switch to the Virtualization Tab and make sure the `my-vm` project is selected. Finally enter the VM detail page.

== Virtual Machine customization

* Now that the Virtual Machine is running, you can start adding some content. Press the `Open Web console` link

* This opens a new window. First Press on the `Guest login credentials` link, and use the information you see to log into the system

* Create a file in the home directory

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
echo "this is my file" > myfile.txt
----

You can now close that Web Console.

== DR Setup

Time to protect this very critical workloads!  +
We are going to use the CLI to perform that operation. +

Make sure you are connected on the PROD cluster:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc config use-context PROD
----

Setting the Disaster Recovery Plan is done in a few steps:

* Configure the "storage peering" between the source and target environments (_already done for you during the lab creation_)
* Create a Trident Protect application (for the whole namespace in this exercise)
* Create an Application snapshot (_and optionally a schedule_)
* Retrieve the application ID
* Setup the Trident Protect AMR (_Application Mirror Relationship_)

NOTE: Creating the AMR can be done with GitOps methodologies to automatically protect your application

=== Create a Trident Protect application for the *my-vm* namespace
Make sure you are logged into the production cluster. +

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
tridentctl-protect create app my-vm --namespaces my-vm -n my-vm
----
Check that the application is present:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
tridentctl-protect get app -n my-vm
----
[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
+-----------+------------+-------+-----+
|   NAME    | NAMESPACES | STATE | AGE |
+-----------+------------+-------+-----+
|   my-vm   |   my-vm    | Ready | 26s |
+-----------+------------+-------+-----+
----

=== Create a Trident Protect snapshot of the *my-vm* namespace

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
tridentctl-protect create snapshot vmsnap1 --app my-vm --appvault lab-vault -n my-vm
----
Check that the snapshot is done:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
tridentctl-protect get snap -n my-vm
----
[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
+-----------+--------------+-----------+-----+-------+
|   NAME    |    APP REF   |   STATE   | AGE | ERROR |
+-----------+--------------+-----------+-----+-------+
|  vmsnap1  |     my-vm    | Completed | 11s |       |
+-----------+--------------+-----------+-----+-------+
----

=== Retrieve the Trident Protect application ID

This ID is required to configure the mirror relationship. +
Place that ID in a variable, and check the result.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
SRCAPPID=$(tridentctl-protect get app my-vm -n my-vm -o json | jq -r .metadata.uid)
echo $SRCAPPID
----

=== Setup the mirroring relationship

The remaining part of this module will be done in the DR cluster. +
Switch context to the DR cluster.
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc config use-context DR
----

You can now create a new namespace which will host the mirror of the app, initiated by an AMR (_AppMirrorRelationship_) setup with Trident Protect.
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc create ns vmdr

cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: protect.trident.netapp.io/v1
kind: AppMirrorRelationship
metadata:
  name: vmamr1
  namespace: vmdr
spec:
  desiredState: Established
  destinationAppVaultRef: lab-vault
  namespaceMapping:
  - destination: vmdr
    source: my-vm
  recurrenceRule: |-
    DTSTART:20240901T000200Z
    RRULE:FREQ=MINUTELY;INTERVAL=5
  sourceAppVaultRef: lab-vault
  sourceApplicationName: my-vm
  sourceApplicationUID: $SRCAPPID
  storageClassName: storage-class-iscsi
EOF
----

[NOTE]
====
When creating the AMR with the tridentctl-protect tool, you don't need to manually create the target namespace. +
Trident will perform that task for you.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
As you need to specify the target storage class when creating an _AMR_, make sure it fits the same protocol and services as the source one.
You cannot mirror from iSCSI to NFS for instance (but you can backup from iSCSI and restore to NFS)
====

Let's check the status of this new object on the DR cluster. +
It should be in the `Establishing` state, which means that the configuration is on-going.

tridentctl-protect get amr -n vmdr

|  vmamr1  |  lab-vault   |    lab-vault    | Established   | Establishing | 41s |       |
+----------+--------------+-----------------+---------------+--------------+-----+-------+
----
It will take a couple of minutes for the mirroring to be setup, or `Established`.

+----------+--------------+-----------------+---------------+-------------+-------+-------+

Everything is now ready. Your VM is protected and the DR plan is setup!

Last thing to check, when the mirror is configured, you will only see the PVC on the target namespace. +
All remaining application objects will be deployed once you activate the DR.

oc get -n vmdr pvc

centos-stream9-sapphire-mink-40   Bound    pvc-6f2e82b1-e901-4a97-bcb5-166125a9d7f3   30Gi       RWX            storage-class-iscsi   <unset>                 6m36s
----

[NOTE]
====
Even though the PVC is labelled RWX, it is currently `Read-Only`, as this volume is the mirror replication target. +
It will become `Read-Write` once you fail over the VM.
====

== Failover your application

Failover your application is pretty straight forward. +
You just need to _patch_ the AMR on the DR cluster. +
This will break the mirror relationship, which in turn changes the volumes from `Read-Only` to `Read-Write`. From there, Trident Protect will redeploy all the protected objects on top of the PVC.

oc patch amr vmamr1 -n vmdr --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"desiredState":"Promoted"}}'

Fairly quickly, you should get to the following status (`Promoting` followed by `Promoted`)

[NOTE]
====
If you needed to tailor the target VM, you could setup a PostFailover Hook with Trident Protect!

== Check the result

Connect to the OpenShift DR Console and navigate to the Virtual Machines menu. It might take a while for the Virtual Machine to fully boot. +
Log into the console and verify what our test file is there. Everything is failed over from the production cluster. 

* Connect to the DR Console and navigate to the Virtual Machines menu:

image::Mod6_OCP_DR_Console_VMs.png[VMs List]

* Check that the VM is `running` and press on the `Open web console` link:

* This opens a new window. First Press on the `Guest login credentials` link, and use the information you see to log into the system

image::Mod6_OCP_DR_Console_CentOS_console.png[CentOS console]

* You will then see the content you created earlier:

Pretty awesome, no?
